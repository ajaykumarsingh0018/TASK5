üîπ SQL Queries

1Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN

Shows only customers who have placed orders.

SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.customer_name, Orders.order_id, Orders.amount
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;


---

2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN

Shows all customers, even if they have no orders.

SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.customer_name, Orders.order_id, Orders.amount
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;


---

3Ô∏è‚É£ RIGHT JOIN

Shows all orders, even if no matching customer exists.

SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.customer_name, Orders.order_id, Orders.amount
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;


---

4Ô∏è‚É£ FULL OUTER JOIN

Shows all customers and all orders (even if no match).
(MySQL/SQLite don‚Äôt support FULL JOIN, so we simulate using UNION.)

SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.customer_name, Orders.order_id, Orders.amount
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id
UNION
SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.customer_name, Orders.order_id, Orders.amount
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;


---

‚úÖ Outcome

Created two related tables (Customers, Orders)

Practiced INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL joins

Learned how to merge and analyze data across multiple tables
